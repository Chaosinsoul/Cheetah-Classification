The main purpose of this project is to create generative methonds in machine learning by scratch.
In this project, we applied multivariate gaussin classifier, Maximum likelihood estimation, Conjugated prior, Noninformative prior,  Naive bayes, MAP, 
Expected Maximization and Gaussian maxiture model to explore how to improve the accuracy of the image processing. The final accuracy is 95.2%.
